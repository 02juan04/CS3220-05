    <h1>The Challenge</h1>

    <p>
      This year's ProgFest will be different from prior years. It consists of
      data structure and algorithm exercises within Android applications. The
      first part of the day will be a 2 hour hands-on workshop on creating very
      basic Android applications. The rest of the day will involve creating
      Android games that require the use of relatively sophisticated algorithms
      and data structures.
      <ul> 
        <li>
          All exercises will be done in Java (with a small amount of XML) - a good
          grasp of Java is required.
        </li>

        <li>
          Knowledge of at least these Java data structures is needed: HashMaps,
          ArrayLists, Sets, Trees, Tries.
        </li>

        <li>
          Knowledge of recursion would be helpful, along with algorithms such as
          breadth-first search and depth-first search.
        </li>

        <li>Knowledge of basic text Java IO would also be helpful.</li>

        <li>
          Practice using Android Studio and deploying Android apps to an emulator
          will make doing the projects easier.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <!-- I used another cal state la logo from their website to give it the cleaner look like in the example.
        The one provided was a bit different with JUST the logo and not the words.-->
